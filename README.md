# Statistics for AI course

This is the material used for my activities within the 2025 Stats for AI course within UPV/EHU's [Applied Artificial Intelligence and its Mathematical Foundations](https://www.ehu.eus/en/web/graduondokoak/university-specialisation-applied-artificial-intelligence-mathematical-foundations)

## Sitting on the shoulders of giants

This course is nothing but my attempt to communicate concepts and topics that I have heard/learned from many experts, so kudos to them, and my strongest encouragement to read/learn from them

### Books

- ["Probabilistic machine learning": a book series by Kevin Murphy](https://github.com/probml/pml-book)

- [Christopher M. Bishop and Nasser M. Nasrabadi. "Pattern recognition and machine learning". Vol. 4, no. 4. New York: springer, 2006.](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)

### Courses
